# Dockerfile for the cookbook site
#
# This is a SIMPLE Dockerfile — no multi-stage build needed because
# CI/CD builds the Astro site before Docker runs. We just copy the
# pre-built static files into nginx.
#
# The Astro build happens in the GitHub Action (Node environment).
# Docker's only job: package the output into a serving container.

# nginx 1.31.3 — comment must stay on its own line: '#' mid-line is not a
# comment in a Dockerfile, and an inline tag note makes FROM unparsable.
