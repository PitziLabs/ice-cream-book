# Dockerfile for the cookbook site
#
# This is a SIMPLE Dockerfile — no multi-stage build needed because
# CI/CD builds the Astro site before Docker runs. We just copy the
# pre-built static files into nginx.
#
# The Astro build happens in the GitHub Action (Node environment).
# Docker's only job: package the output into a serving container.
